# Direction in 2-Risky-Assets-Portfolio
This is a kind of practice notebook for my Security Investment course in 22fall.
Our dear professor Dr.Wang asked us to do a group project in Excel. I thought it was too basic so I tried to finish it in Python.(But for my homework's sake, I had to submit our project in an Excel file,LOLï¼‰
Data are from yahoo finance, which cannot be access within Mainland China, so I used proxy to access the website. And this caused some proxy problems in using web crawling in python.
To save some time, I just directly went to the website and downloaded the exsisted data from "Historical Data" Column(csv file,as can be seen in the code) .
The data contains 5 years' stock close price(not adjusted) of 2 famous companies: Walmart and Amazon.
If there's any more efficient way in cleaning and using these data, PLZ BE FREE TO INFORM ME, I'm more than willing to hear advices in codes.
