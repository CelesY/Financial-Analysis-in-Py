# Direction in 2-Risky-Assets-Portfolio
Data are from yahoo finance, It's an open resource so that everyone can access the data for free. I got these data from "Historical Data" Column(csv file,as can be seen in the code).
The data contains 5 years' stock close price(not adjusted) of 2 famous companies: Walmart and Amazon.
There might be some more efficient ways in cleaning and using these data, I'm still learning on it. And this repository will keep updating and will be extend to N risky assets in the futrue.
