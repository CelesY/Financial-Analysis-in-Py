# Financial-Analysis-in-Py
This is a practice notebook for my Security-Investment course in 22fall.
Our dear professor Dr.Wang asked us to do a group work in Excel. I thought it was too basic and a little bit out of date. So I tried to finish it by Python.
Data are from yahoo finance, which cannot be access within Mainland China, so I used proxy to access the website. And this caused some proxy problem in using web crawling in python
To save some time, I just directly went to the website and downloaded the exsisted data from "Historical Data" Column(csv file,as can be seen in the code) .
The data contains 5 years stock's close price of 2 famous companies: Walmart and Amazon.
If there's any more efficient way in cleaning  and using these data, PLZ TELL ME, I'm more than willing to improve my coding skills.
